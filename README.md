Hello!
My name is Yusra and I have been in the tech industry for about 5 years now. I started my career as an IT User support technician and worked my way upto a Customer Success Engineer for a Cybersecurity firm.
I have a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology and a few industry leading certifications.
I have embarked on a journey to learn new skills and dive into the culture of DevOps.

My understanding of DevOps is that it is a culture of collaboration between Development and Operations team. The goal is for stable and faster deployments of Apps using automated approach. 
Being in tech for 5 years, I have got my hands dirty on a few technologies such as Linux basics, AWS EC2, Computer Networking & Security. 
My aim is to deep dive into the knowledge and skills which constitutes DevOps culture and advance my career as a DevOps/Site Reliability Engineer.

Thank you!
